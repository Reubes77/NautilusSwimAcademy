                <p>
                    Each year, more than 3,400 people drown in the United States. Swimming lessons

                    Swimming can help you improve your health, is a great form of exercise, and helps to burn
                    excess calories. Your body uses a variety of muscle groups, and it is a great cardiovascular
                    workout.

                <p>
                    Swimming will reduces pain during motion as water helps to prevent excess strain on the body. Water
                    is a
                    natural cooling element, which reduces pain while moving stiff joints and sore muscles.
