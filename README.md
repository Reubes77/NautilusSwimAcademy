 # Nautilus Swim Academy

 Welcome to the Nautilus Swimcademy Website.

 The Nautilus Swimcademy is a landing page for people who have a desire to learn to swim, improve their swimming technique, get healthy & improve fitness or to overcome their fear of water. I wanted to create a website that give users a place to find information that would inform them about swimming and seeing this as a healthy lifestyle exercise options as well as attract parents who want to give their children the opportunity to learn to swim in order to better prepare them when faced with water. I aimed to make the website as intuitive and easily to navigate.  

 Users of this website will be able to find the following information: 

  1. learning the benefits of swimming;
  
  2. learn about the Academy ethos and teaching practice;

 # UX

 ### Creative Rationale

When starting the journey on the home page, we wanted the user to get excited in taking this step to becoming a swimmer. I made use of a visually dynamic movement image of a swimmer performing the butterfly stroke rising from the water, as this would create a sense of inspiration and awe. I used this principle to drive the following two pages (About Us and Classes & Fees pages) which the user would navigate to. I felt it important to also add a Gallery page to showcase the diverse students at the Academy and so motivate the user even more to take action and sign up. The Contact Us page allowed the user to be able to sign-up using the form or call, allowing additional options for communication with the Academy. I incorporated a map with a pin location to provide more information for the user if they desired to visit the Academy.

### Colour Scheme

Color drives emotion and careful consideration was taken in pairing colors to compliment each other and the visuals but also drive emeotion. I used 3 basic colors groups and two accent colors for the website to visually compliment the website from a color perspective. The primary colour group used is Blue which gives a sense of competence and trust. The second colour group used is Orange which denotes confidence and bravery and the third colour group is white which drives honesty and simplicity. The two accent colors are greys which compliments the  color white and help soften certain elements in our website. Below is a breakdown of the colors and their usage.

  - #085394 / #9fc5f8 / #6fa8dc used as background color for home and classes pages.

  - #f6b26b / #ff9900 used for fees structure and background color for about page.

  - #222831 used for navbar, headlines and about page text.

  - #ffffff used for headlines and primary text, background color for fees and contact page.

  - #e3e3e3 used for secondary text.

  - #eeeeee used for tertiary text.

### Typography

  [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to help generate font pairings as follows:

  - Montserrat was used for the primary headers.
  - Manrope was used for subheadings and all other text.
  - Montserrat and Manrope were selected because it is a sans serif and compliments the color pairing 
    of Blue and Orange as the font is functional and contemporary. Both are readable and clear fonts, 
    which is ideal for main headings and large sections of text.

  * Font Awesome icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.


## Case stories

  1. Parents realise the need to get their children comfortable and confident in the water at an early age.

  2. Parents want a trusted & reliable swim school to give their children the best skills to be good swimmers.

  3. Some adults have a fear of swimming which stems from their childhood and there is a realisation that they can break 
    that cycle and so search for a swim school.
  
  > Research shows 46 percent of adults are afraid to swim in deep water, and 32 percent of people are scared to put 
    their heads underwater.

  4.  Adults who have suffered form an injury want a exercise regime that is not too strenous on their bodies and find 
      through their research that swimming offers a more gentle method of becoming healthy & fit.

  5. Parents want their children to improve their swimming technique and decide to place them in a swimming school.

  6. Young children & teenagers get inspired by seeing athletes compete on television and want to swim competitively.

### Wireframes created on Balsamiq:

Before I started designing the website, I went to the drawing board to map out the design structure. 
I used Balsamiq to create a wireframe of the website.

    promoting the sense of competence. I used the Blue background color to push the sense of competence through color

    channel to find and interact with the Academy.

## Pages to be created at a later stage:

  - I want to create a testimonial page to help promote the Academy through the voices of students and parents.

    competitions and upcoming swimming events as well as any social events which the Academy holds to raise funds for the school and charity.
