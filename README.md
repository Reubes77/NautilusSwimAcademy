 # UX

 ### Rationale

When starting the journey on the home page, we wanted the user to get excited in taking this step to becoming a swimmer. We felt the use of a visually heroic image of a swimmer mid-stroke rising from the water would create a sense of inspiration. We used this principle to drive each page which the user would navigate to, namely, About Us and the Classes & Fees pages. We felt it important to also add a Gallery page to showcase the diverse students at our Academy and so motivate the user even more to take action and sign up. Our Contact Us page allowed the user to be able to sign-up using the form or call us, allowing additional options for communication with the Academy. We also thought that incorporating a map with a pin location would also provide more information for the user if they desired to visit us.

### Colour Scheme

We used 3 basic colors groups to drive the website visually from a color perspective. The primary colour group used is Blue which drives a sense of competence and trust. The second colour group used is Orange which drives confidence and bravery and the third colour group is white which drives honesty and simplicity and this is also accompanied by greys which help soften certain elements in our website.

  - #085394 / #9fc5f8 / #6fa8dc used as background color for home and classes pages.

  - #f6b26b / #ff9900 used for fees structure and background color for about page.

  - #222831 used for navbar, headlines and text.

  - #ffffff used for headlines and primary text, background color for fees and contact page.

  - #e3e3e3 used for secondary text.

  - #eeeeee used for tertiary text.

### Typography

  [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to help generate font pairings as follows:

  - Montserrat was used for the primary headers.
  - Manrope was used for subheadings and all other text.
  - Montserrat and Manrope were selected as they are both readable and clear fonts, which is ideal for main headings 
    and large sections of text.

  Font Awesome icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### Wireframes created on Balsamiq:

Before we started designing the website, we went to the drawing board to map out the design structure. 
We used Balsamiq to create a wireframe of our website.
